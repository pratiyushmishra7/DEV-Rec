    I built this using node-js as backend and css,js and Semantic-Ui as front-end.The main purpose to make this project was to understand Rest.

To-Do List(A personal task manager):
    This is a simple web app created using J-Query where one can add,delete their task.One can simply download its files and open to see how this
